# Stories and techniques from the Behavioral Economist Rory Sutherland


1. Eurostar Shortening the train time from London to Paris
1. Marketing's job is to either understand what the customer wants and then have you make it or make the customer want what you are offering
1.  The Role of "Signaling"
Story: Sutherland frequently talks about how luxury products like Rolex watches or premium cars aren't about functionality but about signaling wealth or success.
Lesson: Products are often about identity and social status, not just practical utility.

 The IKEA Effect
Story: People place higher value on products they have partially created themselves, like IKEA furniture. This concept illustrates how effort and involvement increase emotional attachment.
Lesson: Consumers derive satisfaction not only from the end product but also from the process of creation.


2. The Shreddies "Diamond" Campaign
Story: When the Canadian cereal brand Shreddies was struggling, Ogilvy rebranded the square-shaped cereal as "Diamond Shreddies" by simply rotating the image on the box. Sales increased dramatically.
Lesson: Innovation doesn't always require a new productâ€”sometimes, reframing the existing one is enough.

1. Insurance call center instead of reducing the operational time, tell people they get the check in 2 weeks and deliver it in 8 days.  They will be thankful for early check.  Related to waiting time for train.  People dont mind waiting if they know how long until the next train.  Takes the stress out.  Also uber watching car arrive.  Got the idea from watching the James Bond movie, Goldfinger.

Electric cars need framing that says the savings of electric over gas.    Hard becuase depends on price of electricity and price of gas and mpg of equivelent car.  Also cars are not measured in electric efficieny by in total range.

Bees waggle dance.  Some bees will ignore group signals and look for new flowers.  Important part - small number of bees are put at risk / out of risk but entire hive benifits from new resource.  This does not work when people have to risk thier own livliyhood because the benifits can not be compounded over a bigger group.  See googles 1/5 indipendent project day.
